The Brownings and the Mossbergs, the angry Colts -- do not fear them: You will never find such as these on your path, if your thoughts remain lofty, if a fine emotion touches your spirit and your body.

      "content": "A ferret visited my house with little tiny cymbals. I felt that I should pick him up but couldn't find my thimbles.He jumped into my dresser drawer (The one with rags and papers) I slammed it shut and taped it tight and gave it to the neighbors.The neighbors liked the furniture but did not like the ferret. They took it to a hardware store to trade it for a parrot.The parrot, now, it sings to me across the narrow alley. I'd like to take it far away, But it's too big to carry.If animals come in your house just make them go away. You can give them to your friends but still you'll have to pay.",
